> This project examined the correlation between **home value prices** and the increase in **technology jobs** within the Greater Seattle Area from 2012 to 2016. It utilized data taken from Zillow as well as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wage in order to evaluate their relationship. We had predicted that these the technology job boom has had a positive impact on house prices. A series of methods such as **time series analysis** and **multiple linear regression**, had indicated statistically significant correlations between the two.
